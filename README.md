# maze
The goal is to generate a maze of given dimensions and to use a
path planning algorithm to the shortest path from the upper left to the lower right corners

Four programs are created:
1. Maze generation
2. Maze solving through A* with motions limited to 1 cell
3. Maze solving through A* with motions using straight lines
4. Maze solving through A* with motions using corridors
